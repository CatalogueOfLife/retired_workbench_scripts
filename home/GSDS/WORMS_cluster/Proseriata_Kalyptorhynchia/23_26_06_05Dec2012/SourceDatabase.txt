World database of Proseriata and Kalyptorhynchia	WoRMS_Platyhelminthes	2012-12-03	2012-12-03	Artois, T. Schockaert, E., Tyler, S. .			A database was developed at the Research Group Biodiversity, Phylogeny of the University Hasselt, in close cooperation with the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ). The end goal of this database is to cover all Rhabditophoran flatworms, providing figures of habitus and important details of the anatomy, literature data and information on distribution. At the moment, only suborders Eukalyptorhynchia and Proseriata are completed and made accessible. Data contributed to the Catalogue of Life via World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), hosted by VLIZ.
