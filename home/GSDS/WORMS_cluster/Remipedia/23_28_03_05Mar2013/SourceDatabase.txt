Remipedia		The Remipedia database contains all currently known and recognized species (and higher taxa). Remipedes are crustaceans that live exclusively in coastal anchialine caves. This global marine species list is part of the World Register of Marine Species database, which aims to provide the most authoritative list of names of all marine species globally. Data have been contributed to the Catalogue of Life via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).
