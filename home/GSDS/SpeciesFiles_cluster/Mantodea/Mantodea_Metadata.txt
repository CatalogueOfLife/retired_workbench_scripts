Mantodea	Praying mantids	<p>The Mantodea Species File (MSF) is a taxonomic database of the world's praying mantids (Order Mantodea), both of fossil and living species. The MSF has full synonymic and taxonomic information for over 2,400 valid species. A future aim of this database is to provide images of the specimens deposited in museums worldwide (especially types), as well as pictures of living praying mantids in the wild and in captivity.</p>  <p>This database originated with Otte and Spearman`s (2005) <i>Mantida Species File</i> catalog.   Please note: The Mantodea Species File database is under development.</p>	Mantodea Species File	Mantodea.speciesfile.org	G	90	4	Mantodea.speciesfile.org/HomePage/Mantodea/img_logo/SiteLogo.jpg	Martin Stiewe
