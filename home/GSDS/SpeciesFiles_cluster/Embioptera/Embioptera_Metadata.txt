Embioptera Species File	Embioptera SF	5.0/5.0	05/31/2016 00:00:00	Maehr, Michael D.	Embioptera	Webspinners	The Embioptera Species File (ESF) is a taxonomic database of the scientific names of the world's webspinners (Order Embioptera = Embiidina = Embiodea). The goal of ESF is to foster research and learning on webspinners, while increasing our understanding of the world's biodiversity. The ESF has information for approximately 400 valid species and 600 total names. Both extinct and extant species are included. Type specimen information is currently available on over half the species. Plans are under development for adding images, distributions and ecological information.
