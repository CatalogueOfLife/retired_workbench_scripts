Psocodea Species File	Psocodea SF	5.0/5.0	05/31/2016 00:00:00	Johnson K.P., Smith V.S. & Eades D.C.	Psocodea	Bark lices & parasitic lices	<p>The Psocodea Species File is a taxonomic database that includes data for Psocoptera (bark lice) and Phthiraptera (parasitic lice).  Data includes synonymies and citations for all recognized species.  Parasitic lice are embedded within bark lice, and thus the single order Psocodea is recognized for both groups.</p><p>The Psocodea Species File currently contains data from "Psocoptera (Insecta): World Catalogue and Bibliography" (Lienhard and Smithers 2002).  Updates for Psocoptera are in the process of being added.  Data from major Phthiraptera catalogs will be added at a later date, together with host associations.  When completed this database will house data from over 10,000 valid species and associated data.</p>	Illinois Natural History Survey, USA; The Natural History Museum, London, UK	Psocodea.speciesfile.org	G	50	5	Psocodea.speciesfile.org/HomePage/Psocodea/img_logo/SiteLogo.jpg	Kevin Johnson
