Chrysididae Species File	Chrysididae SF	5.0/5.0	05/31/2016 00:00:00	Ed Baker	Chrysididae	Chrysidade Species File	The Chrysididae Species File is a taxonomic database of the Chrysidid subfamilies Amiseginae and Loboscelidiinae. These understudied wasps are believed to be obligate egg-parasitoids of stick insects (see Phasmida Species File). The goal of this database is to provide a central point for information about these wasps, including their host relationships which are at present poorly understood. It is hoped that an up-to-date and centralised database will facilitate studies on these enigmatic insects, both by hymenopterists and phasmatologists.
