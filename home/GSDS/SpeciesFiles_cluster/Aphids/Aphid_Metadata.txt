Aphid Species File	Aphid SF	5.0/5.0	05/31/2016 00:00:00	Favret C.	Aphidomorpha	Aphids and allied groups	Aphid Species File is a taxonomic and bibliographic database of the aphids and allied groups of the world. If the authorship attribution of a genus or species of Aphididae is missing, you can find it in a recent literature citation or "scrutiny" record. If your favorite species is not listed with its proper authorship, it simply means the relevant published original description is not yet on file.
